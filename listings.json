The Old Grand-Dad line is in honor of the iconic Meredith Basil Hayden, Sr., commonly referred to as Basil Hayden. He was born on Wednesday January 2, 1743 in St. Mary’s, Maryland to George Hayden, Sr. (1715-July 10, 1754) and Charity Mary Morgan (1718- October 3, 1791). Basil’s family immigrated to the United States from England in the 1660’s, fleeing the religious intolerance for Catholics at that time in their country. In their effort to find refuge, his ancestors found home in St. Mary’s, Maryland which later became the birthplace of Basil himself. He married Henrietta Cole (born July 2, 1754) in 1771 and together they had fifteen children. Nearly a century after the great emigration, in 1785 Basil continued in the faith of his ancestors by leading a congregation of Catholics through the tough journey of hundreds of rugged miles from Maryland to Nelson County, Kentucky. During the time of this journey, Basil and Henrietta had already given birth to nine of their fifteen children, but unfortunately four of them passed away during the perils of the journey to Kentucky. Once the congregation reached the Kentucky lands, they settled and formed farm lands. Henrietta and Basil went on to birth six more children in the Kentucky settlement. Here Basil began small scale distilling in 1788 and was known for using higher rye content in his mash bill than what was typically being used by other distillers of the time. He continued distilling until his death on Sunday July 15, 1804 in Washington County, Kentucky.",

        "Description": "William Larue Weller was born into a distilling family in Kentucky in 1825  and launched his W.L. Weller brand in 1849. Originally a rectification business (creating 'whiskey' using neutral spirit  colouring and flavourings)  this all changed with the Bottled in Bond Act of 1897 and the death of Weller two years later. The company was left in the hands of the fiercely passionate Julian 'Pappy' Van Winkle I who having steered it safely through the wreckage of National Prohibition  established Old Weller alongside the newly acquired Old Fitzgerald labels and the flagship brands for the new Stitzel-Weller distillery in 1933. It was produced there for over 60 years  eventually being sold to the Sazerac Company in 1999  who distil it at Buffalo Trace using Pappy's recipe to this day. This is a 1978 bottling of the 7 year old Original 107 Proof wheated bourbon. This was produced by United Distillers at Stitzel-Weller  although by this point it had been renamed by its previous owners after flagship brand  Old Fitzgerald. The Stitzel-Weller company was officially established in 1933 at the repeal of National Prohibition in the US. It was the result of a merger between the A. Ph. Stitzel distillery and its biggest customer  W.L. Weller & Sons. The Stitzel-Weller distillery opened on Kentucky Derby day in 1935  and quickly developed a reputation for its high quality wheated bourbon  and its main brands were Old Weller  Old Fitzgerald and Cabin Still. The original ownership was shared between Alex T. Farnsley  Arthur Philip Stitzel and Julian Van Winkle. The former passed-away in 1941 and 1947  respectively  leaving the Van Winkle family as the sole heirs to the business. 'Pappy' died in 1965  having handed the reigns to his son  Julian II the year prior  who ran it until 1972 when the board of directors forced him to sell it to the Norton-Simon subsidiary  Somerset Imports. When they were bought over by the American arm of Scottish distillers  DCL  its subsequent iteration invested heavily in bourbon. So much so in fact  that their newly rebuilt Bernheim distillery had such capacity that Stitzel-Weller was rendered surplus to requirements. It was shut down in 1992. Still part of the Diageo portfolio  it has never re-opened and instead now houses the visitor experience for their Bulleit brand.",

Clynelish accounts for 50.9% of the blend and is a parcel of 24-year-old malt, while the Caol Ila accounts for the other 49.1%, and we are only told it is 'considerably older' (rumored to be a 34-year-old). Along with the beautiful artwork on the bottle (the original artwork was partly produced by Da Vinci), this is another stellar whisky highlighting the elements of both distilleries (waxy, grassy, citrus, earthy, and peaty) in a superb blended malt.\n\n\n",

Rich notes of dried fruits, dark chocolate, and toffee are complemented by hints of maritime brine and a subtle smokiness, reflective of its coastal origins. The palate reveals layers of flavor, including sweet sherry notes, caramelized nuts, and spices, with a gentle peat influence that adds depth without overpowering the other elements.\n\nThe finish is long and warming, characterized by lingering notes of oak, dark fruit, and a touch of sea salt. This well-rounded whisky balances sweetness with savory complexity, making it a favorite among connoisseurs.\n\nSpringbank Campbeltown 18 Year is celebrated not only for its rich flavors but also for its craftsmanship and tradition, making it a must-try for those seeking an authentic taste of Scottish whisky heritage.\n",

Then the rich fruits come forward with the caramel playing the supportive role, almost coating the fruits. A bit of smoke wanders throughout. Robust flavors. Finish: The unique Orkney peat comes forward, but a bit more restrained than other HP's. A faint hint of char. At the very end, there's any extremely subtle note of pineapple that the smoke almost covers up. Wish it were a bit longer, but interesting nonetheless.",

      "description": "William Larue Weller was born into a distilling family in Kentucky in 1825  and launched his W.L. Weller brand in 1849. Originally a rectification business (creating 'whiskey' using neutral spirit  colouring and flavourings)  this all changed with the Bottled in Bond Act of 1897 and the death of Weller two years later. The company was left in the hands of the fiercely passionate Julian 'Pappy' Van Winkle I who having steered it safely through the wreckage of National Prohibition  established Old Weller alongside the newly acquired Old Fitzgerald labels and the flagship brands for the new Stitzel-Weller distillery in 1933. It was produced there for over 60 years  eventually being sold to the Sazerac Company in 1999  who distil it at Buffalo Trace using Pappy's recipe to this day. This is a 1978 bottling of the 7 year old Original 107 Proof wheated bourbon. This was produced by United Distillers at Stitzel-Weller  although by this point it had been renamed by its previous owners after flagship brand  Old Fitzgerald. The Stitzel-Weller company was officially established in 1933 at the repeal of National Prohibition in the US. It was the result of a merger between the A. Ph. Stitzel distillery and its biggest customer  W.L. Weller & Sons. The Stitzel-Weller distillery opened on Kentucky Derby day in 1935  and quickly developed a reputation for its high quality wheated bourbon  and its main brands were Old Weller  Old Fitzgerald and Cabin Still. The original ownership was shared between Alex T. Farnsley  Arthur Philip Stitzel and Julian Van Winkle. The former passed-away in 1941 and 1947  respectively  leaving the Van Winkle family as the sole heirs to the business. 'Pappy' died in 1965  having handed the reigns to his son  Julian II the year prior  who ran it until 1972 when the board of directors forced him to sell it to the Norton-Simon subsidiary  Somerset Imports. When they were bought over by the American arm of Scottish distillers  DCL  its subsequent iteration invested heavily in bourbon. So much so in fact  that their newly rebuilt Bernheim distillery had such capacity that Stitzel-Weller was rendered surplus to requirements. It was shut down in 1992. Still part of the Diageo portfolio  it has never re-opened and instead now houses the visitor experience for their Bulleit brand.",

Peat was collected from local bogs to smoke the barley and soft peat influenced water from local sources was used in its careful production. This vintage was produced under the watchful eye of Bessie Williamson, historically the first female whisky distiller who would become a pivotal character in Laphroaig’s history. After an incredible four decades of maturation this release was bottled at a natural cask strength of 42.4% Abv in 2001. With aged stocks of this Islay distillery in short supply this is the only time a 40 year old expression has ever been released.",

      "description": "The Four Roses Super Premium bourbon whiskey is an exclusive offering sold only in Japan, distinguished by its elegant bottle with a silver cap and a rose motif on the label. This whiskey is a blend of various Four Roses recipes, with 80% of the bourbon aged a minimum of 8 years and 20% aged 10 years or greater. It is bottled at 86 proof (43% ABV) and is known for its light copper color and a flavor profile that includes floral and sweet notes, vanilla, and a touch of oak. The finish is described as starting light and sweet with honey and vanilla, then transitioning to a drier side with aged oak and leather, along with a dash of white pepper. The Four Roses Super Premium is sometimes referred to as Four Roses \"Platinum\" due to the color of the embossed roses on the bottle, which are made of light metal. This bourbon is a product of the Kirin Brewery Company, which acquired the Four Roses brand trademark from Diageo in February 2002. While it is a Japan-only bourbon, it is bottled at 750ml, unlike many other export-only bourbons, including Four Roses Black Label, which are typically bottled at 700ml. The Four Roses Super Premium is a unique novelty for bourbon enthusiasts and a must-have for diehard Four Roses fans looking to complete their collection.",

An incredible age statement even older than the industry leading Pappy Van Winkle 23 year, this limited offering was crafted from 11 barrels Julian Van Winkle carefully nurtured. After carefully assessing the barrels he vatted and tanked the liquid in 2014 to prevent any further wood interaction. Bottled at 100 proof just a tiny amount, 710 bottles, were produced from this 11 barrel run. A typical barrel should produce north of 270 bottles, so 25 years of maturation has lead to considerable angel's share. Bottled at 100 proof in a Glencairn crystal decanter and presented in a handmade wooden box. This presentation box was crafted with the staves from the 11 barrels in the vatting.",

      "description": "Blanton's is a bourbon brand from the portfolio of Age International, the company formed by former Fleischmann's Distilling director's, Bob Baranaskas and Ferdie Falke. They had approached Schenley in the early 1980s with a view to purchasing its Old Charter brand, but were instead offered Ancient Age and the George T. Stagg distillery where it was produced. The deal was completed in 1983, two years before the retirement of George T. Stagg master distiller, Elmer T. Lee, who had served there for 36 years, working his way from the bottom up. One of his final pioneering triumphs before doing so was the introduction of mass produced single barrel bourbon, specifically through the creation of the Blanton's brand in 1984.  Normally a 6 to 8 year old bourbon, it is aged in Warehouse H at Buffalo Trace, which is the only metal-clad warehouse at the distillery, commissioned for construction by Albert B. Blanton, after whom the whiskey is named. The warehouse was built shortly after prohibition and being metal, transfers heat quicker than brick warehouses, allowing for more rapid ageing.  The popularity of these products was particularly high in Japan, coinciding with a market boom for American whiskey there in the 1980s. In 1991, with Age International in some financial trouble, a Japanese company called Takaro Shuzo stepped in and acquired a 22.5% stake in the company. In an unusual series of events, they then scuppered a deal the following year that was to see the remaining shares sold to Heublein (a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan). Their deal the year before had included a 30 day right of refusal to purchase the shares for themselves should they be put up for sale. With the deal all but done, the Japanese company stepped in on the final day of the window to acquire full control of the company. As it turned out, their only interest was in the brands, and they had used the 30 days to negotiate a deal with the Sazerac Company of  New Orleans. This saw the American company take ownership of the distillery (which they renamed Buffalo Trace in 1999), as well as the exclusive production and US distribution rights for the Age International labels. This is an arrangement that is still in place today.  This is a 2014 bottling, released for the Japanese market in order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Blanton's brand in 1984.   Since 1999, every bottle of Blanton's has one of 8 different stoppers, each depicting a horse and jockey at a different stage of finishing a race. The designs are all lettered so that a complete set laid out side by side will spell \"BLANTONS.\" ",

      "description": "The Blackened X Willett Masters of Whiskey Series Rye Whiskey Finished in Madeira Casks is a limited edition release that represents a bold collaboration between two renowned whiskey makers. This expression is the inaugural release in the BLACKENED's Master of Whiskey series, showcasing the talents of BLACKENED Master Distiller & Blender Rob Dietrich and Willett Distillery's Master Distiller Drew Kulsveen. The whiskey is a blend of high rye and low rye mashbills from Willett, aged for an average of 6.5 years, with some barrels as old as 8 years. After aging, the whiskey is finished in Madeira casks for 14 weeks and subjected to BLACKENED's proprietary Black Noise process, which uses low hertz frequencies from Metallica's music to vibrate the barrels, enhancing the interaction between the whiskey and the wood. The result is a whiskey with a deep amber color and a rich, complex flavor profile that includes notes of red raspberries, strawberry, mint, charred oak, brown sugar, and a hint of grape, leading to a finish with rhubarb, fig, plum, and spice. Bottled at 109.6 proof, this whiskey is a testament to the art of collaboration and innovation in the whiskey-making process.",

Their selections have included barrels from prestigious brands such as E.H. Taylor, Willett, Four Roses, Blanton's, Eagle Rare, W.L. Weller, and many others.\n\nIn addition to selecting private barrels, Blackout has also developed its own private label bottled under the Blackout brand. The group has shown innovation by repurposing used barrels from their selections to create distinctive blends, including wheated bourbon, bourye, and Four Roses expressions.\n\nThe success of Blackout's bourbon project is attributed to the passion and expertise of its membership, which has enabled them to consistently select high-quality and unique barrels. This focus on exceptional bourbon has not only satisfied their members but has also contributed to their philanthropic efforts through their Barrels for a Cause initiative.\n\n",

Shakespeare  Greetings good gentles and ladies. At High West, we consider whiskey an indispensable part of making it through the long cold winter. One taste of A Midwinter Night's Dram alongside a cozy fire will surely transport you to a dreamlike state. This limited release whiskey is a sumptuous marriage of our Rendezvous Rye finished in both port and French oak barrels. The rye forms a beautiful base of vanilla, caramel and cinnamon; the port barrels enhance with plums and dried fruits; the French oak provides a spice accent. For us, A Midwinter Night's Dram tastes like a proper Christmas plum pudding with lovely mulling spices, dried fruits, and crème anglaise.",

Historically, Q batches were only used at a low formulary percentage for “top notes” in Four Roses Bourbon. The delicate and fresh notes of honeysuckle, rose and lavender – which are very apparent on the nose at younger ages – contribute to the complexity and final character of Four Roses Bourbon. However, once we started aging Q batches longer for our Private Selection Single Barrel Program, the taste changed, melding oak tones from the extra maturation with floral tones to create a candied and rich Bourbon with much more depth and complexity than expressed at younger ages.",

The palate is luscious and well-balanced, with lightly tannic oak complementing rich berry compote flavors. The finish is luxurious, showcasing the synergy between the blended rye and the innovative cherry wood barrel maturation.\n\nAt 110 proof, this limited release celebrates the cutting-edge collaboration between two brands pushing the boundaries of whiskey innovation. The unique flavor exemplifies the potential when modern production meets expert blending and barrel finishing techniques.\n\n",

Crafted with meticulous attention to detail and an unwavering commitment to tradition, Very Old Barton stands as a testament to the artistry and expertise of American whiskey-making.\n\nThe journey of Very Old Barton begins with the selection of the finest corn, rye, and barley grains, sourced from the heart of Kentucky's bourbon country. These premium ingredients form the foundation of a bourbon that embodies the essence of the American South.\n\nVery Old Barton is aged to perfection in charred oak barrels, allowing the whiskey to mature gracefully and develop its signature depth and complexity. As it rests in the rickhouses, nestled among the rolling hills of Kentucky, the bourbon absorbs the nuances of its surroundings, infusing it with the spirit of the land.\n\nPouring a warm amber hue, Very Old Barton entices the senses with its inviting aromas of caramel, vanilla, and oak. On the palate, layers of rich butterscotch, toasted nuts, and spicy cinnamon unfold, creating a harmonious balance of flavors that linger long after each sip.\n\nSmooth and full-bodied, Very Old Barton epitomizes the quintessential bourbon experience, offering a taste of Southern hospitality in every glass. Whether enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or as the foundation for classic cocktails, Very Old Barton is a whiskey that transcends time, inviting you to savor the moment and embrace the legacy of America's native spirit.",

      "description": "The Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit with the pewter top, produced from 1994 to 2001, represents a significant and highly sought-after expression in the distillery's history. This single barrel bourbon, bottled at 101 proof (50.5% ABV), was Wild Turkey's answer to the growing premium bourbon market of the 1990s, particularly in response to the success of Blanton's. The distinctive bottle design, shaped like a turkey with fanned feathers, and the weighty pewter stopper made it stand out on shelves and in collections.\n\nWhat makes the pewter top Kentucky Spirit releases particularly special is their connection to Wild Turkey's heritage. These bottles were often filled with bourbon from Warehouses A, B, and C on the original Tyrone campus, which were personal favorites of Master Distiller Jimmy Russell. The age of the whiskey in these bottles is believed to range from 8 to 14 years, with some early releases potentially containing even older stocks. Tasting notes for these vintage Kentucky Spirits often describe a rich, complex flavor profile featuring the classic Wild Turkey \"funk\" - a combination of robust oak, vanilla, caramel, and spice, with a distinctive fruity and sometimes medicinal character that sets it apart from other bourbons of the era. Today, these pewter top releases are highly prized by collectors and enthusiasts, not just for their historical significance, but for the quality and unique character of the bourbon they contain.\n",

Not lemon nose, but if you can imagine that brightness but with an oak note. After a good 5-10 minutes, the nose is exploding with caramel, its absurd. It's very oily as I swirl it around the glass, lots of streaks.  Palate: Burst of caramel, cinnamon. Extremely light and airy. There is a bit of ethanol from the alcohol, but it fades extremely quickly and shoots back to the caramel note. Its very one-dimensional. I want to say \"short\" but this is really more thin and airy, not brief. The palate is there, but far more subdued than the nose would suggest and its just not complex at all. In my notes I wrote \"watery?\", because it just kinda coats your mouth. Those oils from the glass are all over immediately and you feel it. An initial small burst of flavor from something sitting in an oak barrel for a decade+, but no nuance at all.  Finish: Oh baby. OH BABY. There it is. There's the 10+yr MGP. Its crazy because the palate ends for just a moment you think \"is that it?\", then BAM. Stunning bold oak that is remarkably smooth as it goes down. Honey-ed oak with baking spices. Im honestly amazed by how hard the finish is hitting. Wow. Oak, caramel, cinnamon in that order on repeat for a good 5+ minutes. Wonderful meld of cinnamon and oak for a good few minutes after it goes down. God damn.",

      "description": "Situated in the heart of bourbon country, Augusta Distillery is dedicated to celebrating the community and building upon Augusta's enduring legacy.

The distillery's commitment to quality and tradition is evident in every bottle, ensuring that each sip is a journey into the soul of Kentucky. \n\nBuckner's 13 Year Old Single Barrel Bourbon is a fitting tribute to a decorated revolutionary war hero. This Kentucky bourbon, aged for 13 years, is as intricate and captivating as its namesake. A true embodiment of Kentucky's rich bourbon heritage, this limited-release whiskey captures your senses from the very first sip and offers a rewarding experience from start to finish. With impeccable balance, it pays homage to both the spirit of adventure and the benevolence of Augusta, Kentucky's esteemed founder and statesman.\n\nA true Kentucky bourbon, this limited release whiskey unmistakably captures your attention and rewards you from nose-to-finish. Aged 13 years in new, charred oak barrels, Buckner’s single barrel offers an understated potency with exceptional balance, commemorating the distillery’s inaugural bottling. \n\nColor & Nose - An inviting amber color is the conclusion of an intense 13-year relationship between the mash and its new American oak barrel. The warm, mahogany hue characterizes Buckner’s understated potency that has been deservedly earned as patience gives way to perfection.\n\nPalate - A haunting combination of antique wood, wet soil and dry corn pulls forward from a honeyed vanilla palate. This introduction immediately suggests a rare complexity that can only be found in a true Kentucky bourbon with properly aged maturity.\n\nFinish - Exotic spice and caramel notes are directly complimented by hints of buttery cream and cured tea leaves. Each sip provides an unforgettable experience that instantly returns you to the limestone hills of Kentucky only to demand further exploration.",

With its strategic location along the Ohio River, Augusta serves as a vital link connecting historic river towns to bustling cities. The distillery's dedication to quality and heritage is evident in every bottle, capturing the very essence of Kentucky's bourbon culture.\n\nTake the off ramp and wander along the very river banks where bourbon whiskey first flowed. Old Route 8 invites you to slow down and explore. This exceptional 8-year, cask strength; single barrel bourbon has been crafted in the true Kentucky tradition and patiently matured to offer an elevated experience that can be enjoyed every day. \n\nColor & Nose - Graham crackers, vanilla, and salted caramel greet you as you approach, suggesting that this is a true Kentucky Bourbon. These early notes give way to undertones of cedar and oak foreshadowing that this bourbon has come of age. \n\nPalate - The hints of flavor and complexity created upon nosing are reinforced on the palate.  Flavors of brown sugar, vanilla, and a dash of oak are balanced and revealed in smooth, cascading layers that only time and great liquid can deliver. \n\nFinsih - Long, smooth and lingering, the finish extends the joy of this pour, delivering a classic “Kentucky hug.” Oak, baking spices, with a touch of sweetness are reminders that this is a traditional straight Kentucky bourbon that deserves further exploration.",

        "Description": "Smooth Ambler Old Scout 9 Year is a premium bourbon that represents the distillery's commitment to sourcing and bottling exceptional whiskeys. This expression is part of Smooth Ambler's renowned Old Scout line, which has garnered a dedicated following among bourbon enthusiasts since its introduction.\n\nSourced from MGP in Indiana, this bourbon features a high-rye mash bill of 60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% malted barley. The 9-year aging process in new charred oak barrels allows the whiskey to develop a rich complexity while maintaining a balance between the sweetness of corn and the spiciness of rye.\n\nSmooth Ambler's Old Scout line has an interesting history. It gained popularity in the early 2010s, but was temporarily discontinued in 2016 due to depleting stocks. The return of age-stated Old Scout releases, including this 9-year expression, marks a significant moment for the brand and its fans.\n\nThe Old Scout 9 Year is typically bottled at a robust 99 proof (49.5% ABV), which allows the full range of flavors to shine through. Bourbon enthusiasts often note its well-balanced profile, featuring notes of caramel, vanilla, and baking spices, complemented by the characteristic rye spiciness and a touch of oak from its extended aging.\n\nFor collectors and bourbon aficionados, Smooth Ambler Old Scout 9 Year represents a return to form for a beloved brand. It showcases the art of careful barrel selection and patient aging, making it a sought-after bottle for those who appreciate well-crafted, age-stated bourbons.\n\n",

      "description": "The Founders of Rolling Fork have been long-time admirers of the fine rums being distilled by the powerhouse Foursquare Distillery of Barbados. Thankfully,, the proprietors of that fine establishment are kind enough to let some casks make their way to independent bottlers. When a few casks of rum distilled in 1998 by Foursquare came available, Rolling Fork jumped at the opportunity to bring some of that well-aged rum stateside. The nose smells like someone baked an apple pie in a wood-fired oven using cedar and seasoned oak. In this long-aged rum,, the classic notes of a Foursquare distilled rum,, including floral and citrus make a brief appearance. However,, as may be expected from a rum aged 22 years,, the barrel influence delivers vanilla,, caramel,, and strong baking spice notes. Seasoned oak and baking spice notes take over and lead to a warming cedar and oak finish that lingers. This cask is bottled as nature intended at cask strength,, non-chill filtered,, and without any additives. The yield for this cask was 222 bottles.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Buffalo Trace Distillery began experimenting with recipes and barrel treatments more than two decades ago. Currently there are more than 30,000 experimental barrels of whiskey aging in its warehouses. Each of the barrels has unique characteristics and experimental changes in the mash bill, types of wood, barrel toasts and more. Periodically, an experimental whiskey is bottled and sold on a limited basis.\n\nThis whiskey aged for six years and three months in a new American white oak barrel before it was rebarreled into a used American oak Zinfandel barrel. There it was aged for another eight years, making it a total of 14 years old. The expected wine fruitiness is absent in the initial palate, but is replaced with an exciting spiciness. It is not the rye-grain spice normally associated with bourbon, but a grape-vine herbal quality that slides across the tongue and lingers for what seems like forever. This is an epic whiskey with grandeur and grace. Old world quaffing of a vine and field mélange.",

      "description": "The Blackened X Willett Masters of Whiskey Series Rye Whiskey Finished in Madeira Casks is a limited edition release that represents a bold collaboration between two renowned whiskey makers. This expression is the inaugural release in the BLACKENED's Master of Whiskey series, showcasing the talents of BLACKENED Master Distiller & Blender Rob Dietrich and Willett Distillery's Master Distiller Drew Kulsveen. The whiskey is a blend of high rye and low rye mashbills from Willett, aged for an average of 6.5 years, with some barrels as old as 8 years. After aging, the whiskey is finished in Madeira casks for 14 weeks and subjected to BLACKENED's proprietary Black Noise process, which uses low hertz frequencies from Metallica's music to vibrate the barrels, enhancing the interaction between the whiskey and the wood. The result is a whiskey with a deep amber color and a rich, complex flavor profile that includes notes of red raspberries, strawberry, mint, charred oak, brown sugar, and a hint of grape, leading to a finish with rhubarb, fig, plum, and spice. Bottled at 109.6 proof, this whiskey is a testament to the art of collaboration and innovation in the whiskey-making process.",

An incredible age statement even older than the industry leading Pappy Van Winkle 23 year, this limited offering was crafted from 11 barrels Julian Van Winkle carefully nurtured. After carefully assessing the barrels he vatted and tanked the liquid in 2014 to prevent any further wood interaction. Bottled at 100 proof just a tiny amount, 710 bottles, were produced from this 11 barrel run. A typical barrel should produce north of 270 bottles, so 25 years of maturation has lead to considerable angel's share. Bottled at 100 proof in a Glencairn crystal decanter and presented in a handmade wooden box. This presentation box was crafted with the staves from the 11 barrels in the vatting.",

      "description": "Bottled at 50% ABV, the Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel embodies the spirit of Kentucky's rich farmland along the river, its name paying homage to the fertile lands of the region. This bourbon was introduced as a single-barrel expression, showcasing the remarkable quality and distinctiveness of bourbon unblended from multiple barrels.\n\nTasting Experience: A journey into the heart of bourbon crafting, each sip of Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel echoes the traditional bourbon-making prowess.\n\nNose: The first whiff offers a sweet and spicy aroma, with hints of leather and a subtle touch of roasted marshmallow adding to the complexity.\n\nPalate: Contrary to the sweet notes in the aroma, the first sip presents a drier taste profile with flavors of dark chocolate and tobacco. The bourbon has a dry character, making it reminiscent of a fine single malt but without the peat, appealing especially to Scotch drinkers exploring bourbon.\n\nFinish: The finish is unique, with a gentle burn that travels in reverse, from the chest back up to the throat, lingering until the next sip. This trait makes it a desirable choice for sipping in cold weather, warming up the senses with each sip.\n\nThe Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel, with its higher-rye mash bill (believed to consist of 12% to 15% rye), showcases a different facet of bourbon, offering a taste that is as rich in history as it is in flavor. The bourbon was available in both 100 proof and 80 proof versions, and it resonated well with critics, scoring an impressive 98 points in some circles.",

Beam closed down the Old Taylor distillery and began bottling remaining stocks before using its own Beam spirit for the labels. This 1992 era bottling falls under that transitionary phase and could be using spirit from either the Old Taylor distillery of Jim Beam. The UPC code from the barcode on the rear of the bottle indicates this was likely bottled at the Old Grand Dad distillery and likely will have used left over Old Taylor stocks, however Beam has never given confirmation as to which years they began using their own produced Jim Beam product for these labels.",

      "description": "The Rare Malt Selection was a historic selection of single malt whiskies from operational and lost distilleries that were released by Diageo between 1995 and 2005. As with the Flora & Fauna series, they were often from lesser-seen single malt distilleries. This is a Hillside single malt, distilled in 1970 and bottled at 25 years of age. Known as Glenesk from 1980-85, and prior to that as Hillside since 1964, this distillery produced both malt and grain at different stages in its history. It is not often seen officially bottled, but has contributed to several Rare Malt releases. Distilling ceased there entirely in 1985, and the site operates exclusively as a maltings now.",

      "description": "Glenury Royal was founded by Robert Barclay in 1825, taking its name from the glen that runs through the Ury district. Weeks after opening in Stonehaven, a fire destroyed stocks of barley, along with the kiln and parts of the malting floor. Two weeks after the fire, worker James Clark died in an accident with the boiler. Robert Barclay died in 1854, and the distillery was auctioned to William Richie three years later. The maltings of Glenury Royal were closed in 1968. The distillery then kept producing malt whisky for almost two more decades, but eventually it was mothballed on May 31, 1985. In 1992 the owners decided to cease the malt whisky production at Glenury Royal for good. The buildings of the distillery were sold in 1993 to a property company who turned part of these buildings into apartments.",

      "description": "The Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon, based on a review from 1991, emanates a classic and well-rounded profile. Originating from barrel #288, situated in Warehouse H, Rick 48, and decanted on July 1, 1991, this bourbon displays a proof of 93, indicating an alcohol content of 46.5%.\n\nUpon olfactory examination, this bourbon presents a delightful trio of aromas, encompassing caramel, brown sugar, and sweet herbs, forming a sweet and inviting nose that beckons the taster.\n\nTransitioning to the palate, it initially unveils a sweet landscape dominated by the richness of brown sugar complemented by a hint of maple syrup. As the tasting journey progresses, a notable transition occurs, ushering in a spicier profile mid-palate, which adds a contrasting yet harmonious layer to the tasting experience.\n\nAlthough the review does not correspond to the specific barrel number H-48 288, it sheds light on the meticulous craftsmanship and the quality of flavors one might anticipate from a Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon of the early 1990s era. This vintage bourbon, with its blend of sweet and spicy notes, embodies the timeless and cherished characteristics associated with Blanton's bourbon lineage.",

This edition was specifically bottled for the Japanese market and is characterized by a smooth texture and a powerful, complex palate.

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

      "description": "The 2013 Ardbeg Day whisky is called Ardbog, released on June 1st initially as an Embassy exclusive. Taking inspiration from their last few releases, this is a down-to-earth whisky, concerned with the history uncovered as you dig deep into the peat bogs of Islay. The whisky is a vatting of 10 year old spirit, some matured in bourbon casks and some in manzanilla casks for a balanced of soft, sweet and earthy flavours.",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

      "description": "A huge vintage expression of the demolished Scottish distillery Glenury Royal. Distilled just post WWII in 1953, this cask strength single malt was matured for an incredible 50 years. Glenury Royal spent much of its life providing malt whisky for blended Scotch whiskies such as the King William blend, but also saw small release as a malt whisky in the 1980s. The distillery was demolished in 1983 amid the Scotch whisky downturn of the era, and the site was turned into flats a decade later.",

The palate delivers intrepid notes of warm vanilla, oak, toasted nuts and a rich spiciness with hints of butterscotch or honey. The high alcohol by volume is intense and powerful yet inviting. The deep and resonate finish on this bourbon is nothing short of legendary. Straight from the barrel is best served neat or with a splash of water. Un-filtered, un-cut, unbelievable.",

      "description": "The Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon, based on a review from 1991, emanates a classic and well-rounded profile. Originating from barrel #288, situated in Warehouse H, Rick 48, and decanted on July 1, 1991, this bourbon displays a proof of 93, indicating an alcohol content of 46.5%.\n\nUpon olfactory examination, this bourbon presents a delightful trio of aromas, encompassing caramel, brown sugar, and sweet herbs, forming a sweet and inviting nose that beckons the taster.\n\nTransitioning to the palate, it initially unveils a sweet landscape dominated by the richness of brown sugar complemented by a hint of maple syrup. As the tasting journey progresses, a notable transition occurs, ushering in a spicier profile mid-palate, which adds a contrasting yet harmonious layer to the tasting experience.\n\nAlthough the review does not correspond to the specific barrel number H-48 288, it sheds light on the meticulous craftsmanship and the quality of flavors one might anticipate from a Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon of the early 1990s era. This vintage bourbon, with its blend of sweet and spicy notes, embodies the timeless and cherished characteristics associated with Blanton's bourbon lineage.",

      "description": "Born in the winter of 1881, Albert Bacon Blanton entered the esteemed lineage of bourbon heritage. At a mere sixteen years old, he commenced his journey in the Distillery as an office boy, swiftly ascending to become a pioneering force in bourbon's evolution. Assuming the mantle of company president in 1921, he orchestrated a monumental expansion, propelling the Distillery from 44 to 144 buildings, solidifying its status as the era's premier bourbon producer.  Throughout his tenure until his retirement in 1952, Colonel Blanton curated his exclusive and scarce reserve of bourbon—his personal selection—meticulously stored within the hallowed halls of Warehouse H, now an iconic landmark. Though Colonel Blanton passed in the spring of 1959, his legacy endures.  In 1984, Blanton's eponymous bourbon made its debut, marking the inception of the first-ever commercially available Single Barrel Bourbon. A testament to Blanton's unwavering commitment to excellence, the Single Barrel Bourbon stands as a pioneering achievement, forever altering the landscape of bourbon craftsmanship.",

      "description": "Bottled at 50% ABV, the Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel embodies the spirit of Kentucky's rich farmland along the river, its name paying homage to the fertile lands of the region. This bourbon was introduced as a single-barrel expression, showcasing the remarkable quality and distinctiveness of bourbon unblended from multiple barrels.\n\nTasting Experience: A journey into the heart of bourbon crafting, each sip of Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel echoes the traditional bourbon-making prowess.\n\nNose: The first whiff offers a sweet and spicy aroma, with hints of leather and a subtle touch of roasted marshmallow adding to the complexity.\n\nPalate: Contrary to the sweet notes in the aroma, the first sip presents a drier taste profile with flavors of dark chocolate and tobacco. The bourbon has a dry character, making it reminiscent of a fine single malt but without the peat, appealing especially to Scotch drinkers exploring bourbon.\n\nFinish: The finish is unique, with a gentle burn that travels in reverse, from the chest back up to the throat, lingering until the next sip. This trait makes it a desirable choice for sipping in cold weather, warming up the senses with each sip.\n\nThe Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel, with its higher-rye mash bill (believed to consist of 12% to 15% rye), showcases a different facet of bourbon, offering a taste that is as rich in history as it is in flavor. The bourbon was available in both 100 proof and 80 proof versions, and it resonated well with critics, scoring an impressive 98 points in some circles.",

The resulting spirit was deemed extraordinary to the extent that the team behind East Asia Whisky Company decided to launch a new Collection: The “Yokai”  Series – a collection of mythical creatures from Japanese folklore celebrating extraordinary achievements of select distilleries, starting with the Springbank distillery across exotic cask types and finishes. Only whiskies with a bouquet of flavours that manage to convince our panel to score a point score of 90 or above are selected for this exclusive and highly coveted and collectable series.\"",

      "description": "From the bottler: \"This Single Malt Scotch Whisky was distilled in November of 1996 at the Springbank Distillery and then aged for over 20 years in a first fill oloroso sherry hogshead. It was then finished in a Madeira Single Cask and bottled at 48.8% ABV. The resulting spirit was deemed extraordinary to the extent that the team behind East Asia Whisky Company decided to launch a new Collection: The “Yokai”  Series – a collection of mythical creatures from Japanese folklore celebrating extraordinary achievements of select distilleries, starting with the Springbank distillery across exotic cask types and finishes. Only whiskies with a bouquet of flavours that manage to convince our panel to score a point score of 90 or above are selected for this exclusive and highly coveted and collectable series.\"",

        "Description": "Glendronach was built in 1826 by James Allardice, and rebuilt following a fire in 1852 by an individual named Walter Scott (although not the one you might be thinking of). It eventually passed into the hands of perhaps Scotland's greatest distilling dynasty, the Grants of Glenfiddich. Charles, the youngest son of William Grant procured the then-silent distillery from the government in 1920, and it remained in the family until they sold it to Wm. Teacher 40 years later. The Grants and Teachers were early champions of the single malt category, and distillery bottlings of Glendronach were produced for most of the 20th century until it was mothballed by Allied Distillers in 1996. The distillery was revived in 2002, and has since become one of the strongest single malt brands in the world. This whisky was distilled on 6th May 1994 and aged in single ex-Olosoro sherry cask for 26 years. One of 692 bottles.",

This is the third barrel of Blanton’s they have selected, and we’re honored to have a bottle to explore and share with our readers.   This particular barrel could be best described in a single word: balanced. It touches on all the right flavor notes one might come to expect from Blanton’s, a little oak, honey, caramel, raisin, hints of spice, and some savory notes. The whiskey doesn’t veer too far in any one direction, which makes it an ideal sipper and representative of the Original Single Barrel brand. It’s another great selection from the team and supports a great cause.",

Earmarked from an early stage an ideal component in blended Scotch whiskies, Glenrothes has long been a key part of big brands such as Cutty Sark and Famous Grouse. Its relationship with the former, lead to a three decade-long association with London wine-merchants, Berry Brothers & Rudd, who first approached Highland Distillers about licensing the Glenrothes single malt brand in 1983, eventually trading the Cutty Sark blend with Edrington for full ownership of it in 2010. The distillery itself remained with Edrington through, and the two were reunited when the now hugely successful brand was returned in 2017. Releases from independent labels like this have also always been highly regarded. One of 390 of The Purim Edition 2021 .",

The bourbon features a mash bill of 65% corn, 30% rye, and 5% malted barley, resulting in a rich flavor profile with notes of cherry wood and vanilla. The rye whiskey, made from 95% rye and 5% malted rye, delivers a vibrant, spicy character with minty and peppery aromas.\n\nThe distillery prides itself on its independence, allowing it to innovate without external pressures or shortcuts.

        "Description": "Buffalo Trace Single Barrel Select is a premium expression from the renowned Buffalo Trace Distillery, showcasing the unique characteristics of individual barrels hand-picked for their exceptional quality and flavor profile.\n\nThis bourbon is crafted using Buffalo Trace's signature low-rye mash bill and aged for a minimum of seven years in new, charred American oak barrels. Unlike the standard Buffalo Trace Bourbon, which is a blend of multiple barrels, each bottle of Single Barrel Select comes from a single, carefully chosen barrel, offering a one-of-a-kind tasting experience.\n\nThe Single Barrel Select program allows retailers, bars, and bourbon enthusiasts to choose their own barrel, resulting in subtle variations between selections. This process highlights the artistry of bourbon-making and the impact of individual barrels on the final product.\n\nBottled at a robust 90 proof (45% ABV), Buffalo Trace Single Barrel Select typically offers a rich and complex flavor profile. Tasters can expect notes of vanilla, mint, and molasses on the nose, followed by flavors of brown sugar, toffee, dark fruit, and anise on the palate. The finish is often described as long and deep, with lingering sweet and spicy notes.\n\nFor collectors and bourbon enthusiasts, Buffalo Trace Single Barrel Select represents an opportunity to explore the nuances of barrel selection and the unique characteristics that emerge from individual barrels. These bottles are often highly sought after, not only for their quality but also for their limited availability and the story behind each selection.\n",

      "description": "Balvenie Double Wood 17 Year is a refined expression from the esteemed Balvenie Distillery, known for its commitment to traditional craftsmanship. This single malt Scotch whisky undergoes a unique maturation process, initially aged in ex-bourbon casks before being finished in European oak sherry casks, allowing it to develop a rich and complex flavor profile.\n\nOn the nose, the 17-Year Double Wood presents inviting aromas of oak, vanilla, and cinnamon sugar, complemented by hints of citrus and salted caramel. The palate reveals a delightful interplay of flavors, featuring notes of dried fruits, honey, and creamy toffee, with a subtle spiciness that enhances its depth.\n\nThe finish is smooth and lingering, characterized by warm oak and gentle vanilla notes. This expression beautifully balances the sweetness from the bourbon cask aging with the richer characteristics imparted by the sherry casks, resulting in a sophisticated dram that appeals to both seasoned whisky enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Balvenie Double Wood 17 Year is a testament to the distillery's heritage and craftsmanship, offering a luxurious tasting experience.\n",
